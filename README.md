# About:
-This project is paused right now, because of other projects and university. I will be working heavily on this in late 2017 and early 2018.

-The goal is to make a full fledged dynamic website using HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap), and JS (including JS libraries such as React), from scratch.

-There will be no use of a CMS for this website because it is being made as a learning experience, and to improve my HTML/CSS/JS skills even further.
